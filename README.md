# Quick start
There is a primarily way to run chain-bench as a stand alone cli, that requires the personal access token of your account and the repository url in order to access your SCM.

### For example 
```
chain-bench scan --repository-url <REPOSITORY_URL> --access-token <TOKEN> -o <OUTPUT_PATH>
```

## Please Note
Chain-bench implements the CIS Software Supply Chain Benchmark(TODO: add link) as closely as possible.
You can find the current implemented checks under [AVD - Software Supply Chain CIS - 1.0](https://avd.aquasec.com/compliance/softwaresupplychain/cis-1.0/) that update every night based chain-bench metadata.json files
Please raise issues here if chain-bench is not correctly implementing the test as described in the Benchmark. To report issues in the Benchmark itself (for example, tests that you believe are inappropriate), please join the CIS community.

## Contributing
Kindly read [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) before contributing. 
We welcome PRs and issue reports.

## Roadmap
Going forward we plan to release updates to chain-bench to increase the benchmark coverage with more checks and support more platforms.
chain-bench is an Aqua Security open source project part of Trivy Family.
